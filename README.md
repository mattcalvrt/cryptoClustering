# cryptoClustering
This repo uses Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The analysis includes:
1. Finding the best value for k Using the original scaled DataFrame
2. Clustering cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data
3. Optimizing clusters with Principal Component Analysis
4. Finding the best value of k using the PCA data
5. Clustering cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA data
6. Visualizing and comparing the results
